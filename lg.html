    <h1>Introduction</h1>
<p> <u>Software-defined radio (SDR)</u> is a radio communication system where components that have been traditionally implemented in hardware (e.g. mixers, filters, amplifiers, modulators/demodulators, detectors, etc.) are instead implemented by means of software on a personal computer or embedded system.
</p>
<h1>CFO</h1>
<p> <u>Carrier frequency offset</u> often occurs when the local oscillator signal for down-conversion in the receiver does not synchronize with the carrier signal contained in the received signal. This phenomenon can be attributed to two important factors: frequency mismatch in the transmitter and the receiver oscillators; and the Doppler effect as the transmitter or the receiver is moving.
</p>
<h1>Carrier synchronization</h1>
<p> <u>Carrier synchronization</u> is one of the key components in digital communication systems. Briefly, carrier synchronization concerns the estimation and compensation of the carrier frequency and phase differences between the transmitted signal and the corresponding received signal.</p>
